To generate, run

	make swig 

from the directory above (client). It will 
give you python wrap for eibclient. 

Then from swig directory run the setup for
the python package

    ./setup.py install

And then, run 

python vmonitor1 <url>

to test. 

With your applications, you may have to make sure that you copy the 
resulting shared library to your python application's path and do 

from   eibclient.eibclient import *
from   eibclient.common    import *

99-eib.rules:

This is a sample udev rules files to be installed into /etc/udev/rules.d.
This file can be used to grant eib access to non root users.

You will probably want to comment out all lines of devices, which you
don't own.

If you want grant access to a specifc user, you need to add
OWNER="<user>"
to each rule. If not, the owner is most likely root.

If you want to change the group, you need the following setting:
GROUP="root"

You can choose three permission level:
* every user on your system
MODE="0666"
* only user and group specified in the rule
MODE="0660"
* only user specified in the rule
MODE="0600"

The file contains udev rules for some known KNX USB interfaces, but
the list will likely be incomplete. If your interface is not listed,
you can do the following:

1) run
$ lsusb -v  
2) Search your device in the list. One example:
  idVendor           0x0e77                             
  idProduct          0x0111                             
  bcdDevice            2.01                             
  iManufacturer           1 Siemens AG                  
  iProduct                2 KNX/EIB-USB Interface (Flush mounted)
3) Note the values of idProduct and idVendor
4) Create add new rule inserting the values at the end of the file:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device",ATTR{idVendor}=="<value of idVendor>", ATTR{idProduct}=="<value of idProduct>",GROUP="root",MODE="0666"

Please mail me the lsusb -v output of your KNX USB interface, so that
I can add it to the BCUSDK distribution.

---------------------------------------------------------

After the legal warning, what does this mean:

Every thing, except eibd, transforms only files like a normal
compiler and is not really dangerous.

In the default configuration, eibd is only dangerouse, if a
buffer overflow (or similar) is found, because all bus access
backends are disabled.

Run eibd in a controlled environment, where you don't expect
malicious people, because eibd has no access control mechanisms
in it. Additionally there has been no audit for security problems.

At configure time, you have to enable all backends, with which
you like to work (It is possible to enable all, if you like it).

Running eibd on Linux 2.6.x (where x is < 11) may crash your kernel,
even as normal users, if the tpuarts or bcus backend are used.
Linux 2.4.x is not affected.

With eibd you can send arbitrary telegrams on the EIB bus, which
may destroy your EIB configuration or cause a hardware damage.

The problematic operation are:
*) writing memory
*) writing a property
*) writing individul addresses
*) loading a image

See the BCU SDK documentation for how to recover from errors (Chapter Usage).
A recovery should always be possible, if you have access to the PEI
of the BCU.

----------------------------------------------------------

How to use the BCU SDK is covered in the documentation.
Parts of the BCU SDK even run on Windows using Cygwin.
See the webpage about it.

---------------------------------------------------------

After the legal warning, what does this mean:

Every thing, except eibd, transforms only files like a normal
compiler and is not really dangerous.

In the default configuration, eibd is only dangerouse, if a
buffer overflow (or similar) is found, because all bus access
backends are disabled.

Run eibd in a controlled environment, where you don't expect
malicious people, because eibd has no access control mechanisms
in it. Additionally there has been no audit for security problems.

At configure time, you have to enable all backends, with which
you like to work (It is possible to enable all, if you like it).

Running eibd on Linux 2.6.x (where x is < 11) may crash your kernel,
even as normal users, if the tpuarts or bcus backend are used.
Linux 2.4.x is not affected.

With eibd you can send arbitrary telegrams on the EIB bus, which
may destroy your EIB configuration or cause a hardware damage.

The problematic operation are:
*) writing memory
*) writing a property
*) writing individul addresses
*) loading a image

See the BCU SDK documentation for how to recover from errors (Chapter Usage).
A recovery should always be possible, if you have access to the PEI
of the BCU.

----------------------------------------------------------

How to use the BCU SDK is covered in the documentation.
Parts of the BCU SDK even run on Windows using Cygwin.
See the webpage about it.

----------------------------------------------------------

!! YOU SHOULD NOT RUN EIBD AS ROOT !!

The only privileges, which eibd needs, are access to the bus
interface.  For the BCU 1, you only need to grant read and write
access on the device node (/dev/eibX) to the user running eibd. For
all other eibd backends based on the serial driver, you need to grant
only read and write access on /dev/ttySx. The EIBnet/IP backends
require no privilege. The USB backend requires read and write access
to the file representing the device in usbfs (normaly mounted at
/proc/bus/usb) or in /dev managed by udev.

contrib/linux/99-eib.rules contains a sample udev rules file, which shows 
how to grant permissins with udev.

KNXLive! (http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/knx/knxlive.html) contains
since version 0.2 a EIBD setup wizard.

The shell script is also part of knxconfig_0.0.2.tar.gz (available at
http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/knxlive), filename
knxconfig-0.2/setup/setup-eibd.sh.

It can be used as reference, how to start eibd for the various
supported interfaces and how to run eibd as normal user.

The shell script was written for the KNXLive! CD. If you intend to run
it on a normal linux system, please take care of the folloing things:
* The BCU SDK installation directory must be in the path
* dialog or Xdialog must be installed
* If you are using a BCU 1, you must load the BCU 1 driver module before.
* The script expects, that it can executed commands as root via sudo without any password prompt.
* The scripts grants access on /dev/ttyS0-ttyS3, /dev/eib0-eib3 and all KNX USB Interfaces to every user on the computer.
* Status files are put under easy guessable names in /tmp
* If you notice a problem, you should start the script in a terminal to catch all error messages
